This function is responsible for helping the operator to easily
manipulate a subset of a buffer's contents within a new buffer. The
newly created clone buffer is created with `clone-indirect-buffer',
so all of its behaviors apply.

The subset chosen for manipulation is narrowed by
`narrow-to-region'. When the clone buffer is created, the lines in
which the start and end of the boundary occur are included at the
end the new clone buffer name to serve as a reminder for its
'true source'."
