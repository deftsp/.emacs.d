  "Call `redisplay' to trigger mode-line height calculations.

Certain functions, including e.g. `fit-window-to-buffer', base
their size calculations on values which are incorrect if the
mode-line has a height different from that of the `default' face
and certain other calculations have not yet taken place for the
window in question.

These calculations can be triggered by calling `redisplay'
explicitly at the appropriate time and this functions purpose
is to make it easier to do so.

This function is like `redisplay' with non-nil FORCE argument.
It accepts an arbitrary number of arguments making it suitable
as a `:before' advice for any function.  If the current buffer
has no mode-line or this function has already been called in it,
then this function does nothing."
