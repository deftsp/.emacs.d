;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;; doom-emacs: A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up
;; the gc threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later
;; by enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
