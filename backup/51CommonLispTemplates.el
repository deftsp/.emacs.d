;;; A template for ASDF system files:
(with-eval-after-load "auto-insert"
  (push `(("\\.asd\\'" . "ASDF Skeleton")
          "System Name: "
          "
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
  (unless (find-package :" str ".system)
    (defpackage :" str ".system
      (:use :common-lisp :asdf))))


(in-package :" str ".system)

(defsystem :" str "
  :description " ?\" (read-string "Description: ") ?\""
  :author \"" (user-full-name) " <" user-mail-address ">\"
  :licence \"" (read-string "License: ") "\"
  :version \"" (read-string "Version: ") "\"
  :components (())
  :depends-on ())")
        auto-insert-alist))

;; How do you use this ?
;; It should work automatically if you have auto-insert enabled:
;; (add-hook 'find-file-hooks '(lambda ()
;;                              (auto-insert)))

;; and you open an empty file ending in ".asd"
;; It will ask you about
;; * The name of your package,
;; * a short description,
;; * license you put this package under,
;; * and the version number of you newly created package.

;; Modifications

;; One might want to use TAB completion for the license and default values for the version numnber:
;; Just change two lines:

;; :licence \"" (completing-read "License: " '(("GPL" 1)
;;                                ("BSD" 2))) "\"
;; :version \"" (completing-read "Version: " nil nil nil "0.1") "\"

;; And fill in the missing licenses. Of course this makes it impossible to use a license with spaces in the name that's
;; not on the list. You can always change it later.

;; One could also change the skeleton to not read the system name as a string but with a default of the name of the
;; current directory. This is left as an exercise to the reader or next editor
